    go get github.com/kkdai/photomgr

Usage
---------------------

refer `cmd/ptt_cli` or `cmd/ck101_cli` for more detail. 

```go
ptt := NewPTT()

//Set path for download image
ptt.BaseDir = "YOURPATH"

pageIndex := 0

totalPostCount := ptt.ParsePttPageByIndex(pageIndex)

//iterator this sample
for i := 0; i < totalPostCount ; i_++ {
		title := p.GetPostTitleByIndex(i)
		likeCount := p.GetPostStarByIndex(i)
		fmt.Printf("%d:[%dâ˜…]%s\n", i, likeCount, title)
		
		//download image 
		url := p.GetPostUrlByIndex(i)
		p.Crawler(url, 25)
}


```

Gomobile supported
--------------

To let your package support [gomobile](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile), need note as follow:

- Only support `string`, `int`  (no slice and array)
- Need a constructor for your structure such as `NewYOUROBJ() *YOUROBJ`.
